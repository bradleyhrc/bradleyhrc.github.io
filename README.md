# My portfolio website!

## Redesign
This is version 2 of my website, where I've worked with new technologies to deploy a clean, professional, and minimalist portfolio. Completed April 2022. Click **[here](https://www.bradleyhc.com)** to view it live on the internet!

## Technologies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

I'm very happy with the final product and it was super interesting to learn how React JS & Gatsby work. Web design has always been very fun for me ðŸ˜Š.
